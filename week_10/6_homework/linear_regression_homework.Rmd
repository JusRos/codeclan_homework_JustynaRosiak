```{r}

library(tidyverse)
# load thea data
project <- read_csv("data/project_management.csv")
project <- project %>% 
  select(-...1)

```

```{r}
# Plot the data, taking estimated_length as the independent variable and actual_length as the dependent variable.


project %>% 
  ggplot(aes(estimated_length, actual_length))+
  geom_point()

```

```{r}

# Calculate the correlation coefficient of estimated_length and actual_length and interpret the value you obtain.

project %>% summarise(correlation = cor(estimated_length, y = actual_length))
```
The correlation between estimated_length and actual_length of the project shows a strong correlation.

```{r}

# Perform a simple linear regression using actual_length as the dependent variable, and estimated_length as the independent variable. Save the model object to a variable.

model <- lm(formula = actual_length ~ estimated_length, data = project)

```
```{r}
library(modelr)

sample <- project %>% 
  add_predictions(model) %>% 
  add_residuals(model)
```
```{r}
sample %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = estimated_length))+
  geom_point( aes(y = actual_length))+
  geom_line(aes(y = pred), col = "red")
```
Interpret the regression coefficient of estimated_length (i.e. slope, gradient) you obtain from the model. How do you interpret the r2 value reported by the model?
Positive correlation between estimated and actual length of a project. 
 
```{r}
library(broom)

glance(model)
```

64.7% of a variation in estimated length in the sample data can be explained  by variation in actual_length of a project.

```{r}
tidy(model)
```
```{r}
library(ggfortify)
autoplot(model)
```
checking the independence of variables (residuals vs fitted) - looks like  they're independent. Normal Q-Q tests the normality of residuals  - it looks like the residuals are normally distributed.
It looks like the relationship is statistically significant.
