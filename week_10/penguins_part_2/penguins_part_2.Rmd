For this task, we just want you to add a correlation matrix to your previous penguins analysis from week 6 and interpret it, as well as writing a short piece of documentation that covers all your analysis steps with the penguins data.

# 1. Correlation matrix

Create a correlation matrix using `GGally::ggcorr()` that shows the correlation between bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass across species. (Hint: you can add correlation coefficient labels to your plot if you look at the `?ggcorr` help file)

**Write a short summary of your results.**

# 2. Documentation

Create a document/README which provides documentation for your analyses (including the ones from Part 1), describing your process broadly, e.g. what analyses you have done as well as any assumptions etc.


# PDA outcomes covered by this task

* 4.5 Concept of __correlation and correlation matrices__
* 4.8 Documenting analyses
